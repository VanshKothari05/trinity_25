              Trinity embodies the spirit of D.J. Sanghvi as the most
              anticipated and cherished annual socio-cultural, sports and
              technical festival. Trinity is a coalescence of innovation and
              technology, festivities and social responsibilities, and the
              competitive streak of sports. The grandeur of Trinity is sure to
              attract students not only from Mumbai but from colleges all around
              the world.

              The coveted IDPT trophy will be fought for by the students of the
              college. The department who shows exemplary teamwork and
              dedication will be the ones to lift this trophy. We are bound to
              have clashes between departments during the fest, but that will
              just make everyone hungrier to win it. The winner will take home
              bragging rights for a year, whereas those who don‚Äôt win will have
              that extra bit of motivation for next year. But remember the most
              important thing is to participate because as the saying goes, you
              either win or you learn.

              In a short span of 30 years, Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of
              Engineering (DJSCE), an Autonomous Institution, affiliated to the
              University of Mumbai and owned by SVKM has come a long way and has
              made its impact felt not only in the country, but also abroad. Our
              students have been performing exceedingly well in national and
              globally competent multinational companies and also in the
