//               The coveted IDPT trophy will be fought for by the students of the college. The department who shows exemplary teamwork and dedication will be the ones to lift this trophy. We are bound to have clashes between departments during the fest but that will just make everyone hungrier to win it. The winner will take home bragging rights for a year whereas those who don’t win will have that extra bit of motivation for next year. But remember the most important thing is to participate because as the saying goes you either win or you learn.

//               In a short span of 29 years, Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering (DJSCE), an Autonomous Institution, affiliated to the University of Mumbai and owned by SVKM has come a long way and has made its impact felt not only in the country, but also abroad. Our students have been performing exceedingly well in national and globally competent multinational companies and also in the universities in India and abroad as they pursue their higher education.

//               The theme revolving around the elements—Prithvi (Earth), Vayu (Air), Agni (Fire), Jal (Water), Samay (Time) and Vidyut (Electricity)—captures the essence of the natural forces that govern our world and existence. These elements symbolize the dynamic balance of life, each contributing uniquely to the cycle of creation, sustenance, and transformation. Together, they form an interconnected web that embodies both the physical and metaphysical realms, reflecting ancient wisdom and contemporary relevance.

//               As the ancient Sanskrit saying goes, "पञ्चमहाभूतानि देहस्य धारिणः" (Pancha Mahabhutani Dehasya Dharinah)—the five great elements are the bearers of the body, underscoring the profound connection between these elemental forces and our very being.
